            <h1 class="project-name">Thirsty?...Take a Sip</h1>
            <p class="project-description"><i>Thirsty?....Take a Sip</i> is a catalog of my personal influences , categorized into five distinct beverages. Each drink represents a different aspect of who I am. Water holds the essentials, core influences I can’t live without. Coffee represents my power boosters: the things that energize and motivate me. Thai Tea captures the cultural influences that shape my identity as a Thai woman. Hot Chocolate warm, comforting influences in my life. Lastly, Negroni is reserved for the bittersweet: the complex, acquired influences that have challenged and changed me. This catalog invites you to explore what moves me, one sip at a time. </p>
